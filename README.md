# **CS 21 Project 2: Extending a 32-bit CPU Instruction Set.**

### **Description**
For this project, we were tasked to extend the MIPS 32-bit Single Cycle Processor (SCP) (Harris & Harris, 2013) instruction set (please see `CS21_Project2_Specs.pdf` for full specifications).

A nuanced understanding of **Hardware Definition Language** (HDL) (specifically **SystemVerilog**) and digital circuits (especially the **datapath** and **control path**) is key to succeeding on this project. We modified the processor to accomodate 5 new instructions:
1. Shift left logical (sll)
2. Store byte (sb)
3. Branch on less than or equal (ble)
4. Load immediate (li)
5. Zero-from-right (zfr)

Please see my Documentation Intro (`For Submission\Hebron_Yenzy_202003090_LAB4.pdf`) or the MIPS Green Sheet (`MIPS Green Sheet (Berkeley).pdf`) for the MIPS32 instruction formats. You may also consult Appendix B of Harris & Harris (2013) or the Project 2 Specs for the complete instruction set and their expected effect.

Our technical documentation skills were also sharpened by this project, one that required *line-by-line* explanation of code. Discussed in the documentation *per added instruction* are:
* HDL edits
* Testbench for simulations. 
* Test code (in assembly and in machine code) for verifying if the extended instruction set is working.
* Demonstration that the processor can now successfully execute the instruction required.

Extreme care was also taken to maintain the baseline integrity of the single cycle MIPS processor. That is, we extended the capability of the CPU *without breaking anything* in the process.

### **Requirements**
It is suggested for you to only watch the video documentation or skim through the written documentation due to the tediousness of the subject. However, if you wish to verify this endeavor's results on your end, the following would be needed.
- Windows 10 or higher
- For high-performance systems, one may use Xilinx Vivado 2021.2 Suite: Download through https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2021-2.html (will require account registration).
- For low-performance systems, one may use EDA Playground. Web app through https://edaplayground.com/ (will require account registration). Please see Project 2 Specs page 25 for full guide. 
- Minimal space and at least 4 GB memory for EDA playground. At least 70 GB of space and 8 GB of memory for Xilinx Vivado.

### **Running the Program**
The sudoku solvers can be run in two ways.

1. **Through the MARS GUI.** In the menu bar, click File>Open, then navigate to the sudoku solver assembly files. Afterwards, in the toolbar, click Assemble (tool and wrench icon) then click Run (play icon). In the lower left, the execution pane will be visible through which you can paste test cases such as those found in the included 4x4.txt and 9x9.txt files in `"For Submission\"`. Note that inputting test cases through the MARS GUI can only be done line-by-line.
2. **Through cmd.** Open your command line, `cd` to `"For Submission\"` (where `mars.jar` already exists), then run `java -jar mars.jar <file_name>`. File name could be `4x4solver.asm` or `9x9solver.asm`. You may now input your valid test cases to the cmd. 
### **Sample I/O**
For the 4x4 solver, an input is formatted as:
```
1000
0001
0400
0020
```

Which outputs:
```
1342
4231
2413
3124
```

For the 9x9 solver, an input is formatted as:
```
005800009
210000050
070900600
000201035
000000000
780405000
004006020
030000061
600003500
```
Which outputs:
```
465812379
219367458
378954612
946271835
523698147
781435296
154786923
832549761
697123584
```
